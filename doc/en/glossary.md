# Glossary - Ubiquitous Language for This Initiative

Settling upon a common set of terms for the topic at hand, striving to use the vocabulary of a given business domain, not only in discussions about the requirements for a software product but in discussions of design as well and all the way into the productâ€™s source code itself, is a way to mitigate confusion and connect a given feature or story to a corresponding real-world factor through the use of common terminology.

This statement is inspired by Eric Evans and his book, *Domain Driven Design*, 2003.
