# Local Tessellation Graph Management

Given a local organization or project, facilitate the creation and maintenance of RDF source files (eg Notation3 graph description, typically indicated with a .n3 filename extension) for the organization or its projects, and serialization of graph data to the most common RDF/XML (or application/rdf+xml) output for publication and interrogation.
