# Tessellation Initiative Overview

This Overview repository is an initiative and documentation component of the *Tessellation Initiative Project*.

**Please do not add code to this repository.**

The goal of the Tessellation Initiative is to establish an opt-in, decentralized means of discovery to connect, communicate, and collaborate, initially among individual civic volunteers, formal and information civic volunteer organizations and perhaps others. There is no reason this scheme would not work to loosely-connect any individuals and groups around projects or other endeavors.

Making use of long-standing, tried-and-tested methods of meta data structure, publishing, and sharing via automated spider pull, we can bring new individuals, cohorts, and organizations into a collaborative, bottom-up environment and, with individual project discovery and capture, assist with discovery of overlap and potential points of collaboration. Communication is, of course, essential.

## Project Policies

Unless otherwise and specifically indicated with replacement files in this repository, this project will adhere to the default Project-ACT policies for Code of Conduct and Contributing, found at

* [Code of Conduct - Project-ACT](https://github.com/Project-ACT/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [Contributing to this Project - Project-ACT](https://github.com/Project-ACT/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Organization Workflow

Members of Project-ACT, contributors and collaborators alike, are presumed to be familiar with the HOWTOs that detail such things as use of GitHub, project and repo naming conventions within our organization, and our approach to Agile for Volunteers (or Volunteer Agile) which will, like all our projects, be a collaborative work in progress. These, coupled with the Contributing document linked above, are important and you should be familiar with them before diving in.
